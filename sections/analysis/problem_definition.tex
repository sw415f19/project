\section{Problem definition}
After analyzing the target group, current solutions and choosing the programming paradigm, it is time to create a problem definition. \\ The objective in this project is to create a programming language that is easy to use for an average user who may or may not have any experience in programming. The programming paradigm will be procedural and should be targeted toward Arduino devices that can be used for home automation. So the problem definition is formulated as:\\
\\

%JA: WHERE SHOULD THIS SECTION COME?!
%\textit{It is a problem that users sometimes forget to close their windows or turn off their lamps, which will increase their bill in electricity, therefore is it possible to create a programming language connected to a device to make those forgetful task automatically?}

\textit{In a world of increasing microchip automation, programming becomes a basic mainstream skill. To assess this, a procedural programming language should be designed, which can be used for people, with little or no prior programming knowledge.}
