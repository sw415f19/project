\subsection{Program Example}
This section will provide some example code, which was created in the early iteration of the project development, in the Ezuino programming language syntax. The first code snippet is in figure \ref{ex01}, which is one the largest general code examples written for the Ezuino language. This code snippet has been a part of the unit tests in several areas of the compiler. \\
From lines 1-10, we declare the variables in all the types, the Ezuino language support. \\
Line 13-22, we assign the previously assigned variables some values equal to their respective type. \\
Starting from line 23, the findMedium function will take the input of the four integer declarations made earlier. Inside the function, we test the variable declarations in functions and assignment, using ret on line 28.\\
At the end of the function, we take the sum of the input variables on line 29 by dividing them with 4. \\
In the last part of the example code starting from line 32 we define another function, named asd. Inside asd function, we have a while loop and a if else statement. We also call the findMedium function as the right hand part of an assignment. Both the while loop and if else statements uses boolean variable declarations or statements.
