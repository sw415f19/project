\subsection{Problem scoping}
This section will what features we will not prioritize due to time limitations.\\

\\
\subsubsection{Scope of features}
As there are a lot of IoT devices and other Arduino models, the project will be limited to be developed and tested on Arduino Uno.

\subsubsection{Scope of tests}
As it is essential that the compiler does not contain errors, testing will get focused to a greater extent of this project. Testing of the program, JUnit test should be done in the significant fields of code and functionality, together with running automated Continuous Integration (CI), which will run the tests in every build, together with a PR/Code Quality manager running as a static code analyser. Further testing, such as code coverage test, will not be considered in this development phase. \\


As the scoping reach an end, we can start putting a problem definition together, where we can define the exact problem that we in which can solve with this programming language.
