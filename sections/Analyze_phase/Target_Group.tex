\subsection{Targeted group}
\label{targetedGroup}
The target group that this project is focused on are the common individual who lives in a house or appartment. Since it is a very large target group, the experience on how to use the product can be different. So a PACT analysis was made in order to better understand the targeted group.

People (P): The main group are people who lives in a home, this would mean that the age would be 18+ for the group. The learning experience on how to use technology wary very much since elderly people can have little to no experience at all on how to use technology while people who are aged around 18-30 would better handle technology and how to use them. \\
\\
Activities (A): The product should be able to automatised different task, that is performed a lot. For example at Spring, if it gets too warm in the house the product should be able to automatically open the window and close the window again after it has registered the room temperature. The signal would be for example when the room temperature is below 23 degree Celsius. The window would be locked and over 28 degree Celsius the window would open. \\
\\

Context (C): The product will be used inside a house so the it will be used mostly as a tool to keep things running automatically.\\
\\

Technologies (t): The technology will be used with Arduino as the hardware and a charger that will keep the Arduino running. %Maybe a screen is neccesary to input the code\\
