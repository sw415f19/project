The goal of Ezuino is to be an easier option for people previously unfamiliar with code. In order to evaluate whether this criteria has been achieved or not, it is necessary to have metrics to evaluate the language. We have chosen the metrics from \cite{conceptsOfProgrammingLanguages}, that evaluates a language based on the metrics readability, writability and orthogonality and cost. For the purpose of a language meant for home automation for people new to programming, and not a programming language meant for industry, the metric cost will not be taken into account. \\
After describing the theory behind the evaluation criteria, the language features Ezuino will include compared to C will be described. How these features affect language design criteria will also be covered. At the end of the chapter there will be an summary of all the features that are affected by the language design criteria.
