\section{Targeted group}
\label{targetedGroup}
The target group in which this project is focused on are the ordinary individual who lives in a house or apartment. Since it is a huge target group, the experience on how to use the product can be different. So a PACT analysis was made in order to understand the targeted group better.

People (P): The main group is people who live in a home, this would mean that the age would be 18+ for the group. The learning experience on how to use technology vary since seniors can have little to no experience on how to use technology. While people aged around 18-30 would better handle technology and how to use them. \\
\\
Activities (A): The product should be able to automate a different task. For example at Spring, if it gets too warm in the house, the product should be able to automatically open the window and close the window again after it has registered the room temperature. The signal would be, when the room temperature is below 23 degree Celsius and over 28 degree Celcuis the window would close and open. \\
\\
Context (C): The product will be used in an indoor and outdoor apartment, in all types of weather. The product can be used at all times of the day, and require an Arduino to program the different devices.
\\
Technologies (T): The technology will be used with Arduino as the hardware and a charger that will keep the Arduino running. %Maybe a screen is neccesary to input the code\\
