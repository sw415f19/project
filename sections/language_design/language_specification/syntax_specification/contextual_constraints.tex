\subsection{Contextual Constraints (Scope rules and type rules)}
Scoping.

There are 3 different kinds of block structures:
\begin{list}
    \item Monolithic
    \item Flat
    \item Nested
\end{list}

Monolithic: Only 1 scope, global scope. Makes it hard to see where the variables are modified since all variables are available everywhere. Especially if the code can be split over multiple files.
Flat Block Structure: Multiple scopes but limited to being in global scope. Enables local variables but limits variables to existing only in that scope.
Nested: Blocks within blocks. More flexible, but can be hard to remember which variables are defined in what scope.
