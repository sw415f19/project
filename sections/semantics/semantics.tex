\section{Abstract Syntax for Ezuino}
At this stage, we got the syntax made, and we have a general idea of the language. The next step is to construct semantics for the Ezuino programming language. This chapter will go through each semantic rule, in categorized. 
Before we can start on semantics, we need a table, to provide an overview of the short names in each semantic. This can be  reviewed in figure \ref{semCat}.

\section{Type System Semantics}
The Ezuino programming language data types is only primitive types. This is denoted in future references as :
\begin{table}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{longtable}[c] { r c }
      
        \( { T_{TP} = (string,\ bool,\ double,\ integer)} \) \\
    \end{longtable}
    \caption{}\label{s-empty}
\end{table}
