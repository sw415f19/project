\section{Problem definition}
 After gathering information about current solutions and explaining how the syntax and statement works from the initial problem, is to define the problem that this project is trying to solve. \\ The objective in this project is to create a programming language that is easy to use for an average user who may or may not have any experience in programming, while the programming language will be implemented to an Arduino device that will automate a device at home, which is called home automation. So the problem definition is formulated as:\\
\\
\textit{It is a problem that users sometimes forget to close their windows or turn off their lamps, which will increase their bill in electricity, therefore is it possible to create a programming language connected to a device to make those forgetful task automatically?}
