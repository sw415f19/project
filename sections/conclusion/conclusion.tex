\chapter{Conclusion}\label{ch:conclusion}
In the problem statement, the goal was to implement a procedural programming language, which were easy to learn and usable for beginners or people with no prior programming experience for the Arduino. \\
\\
During the project, we have been through multiple iterations in the syntax, precedence, CFG and compiler development, which development could have been further expanded with additional Arduino syntax, and implementing for example lists and structs. The user feedback we conducted earlier which, showed a good advancement in the user friendliness of the current syntax, and provided some good feedback which will be looked through in future iterations of the Ezuino compiler.\\
\\
We can conclude from this, that we have implemented a working compiler which to the degree of the user test fulfills the problem statement. We believe that the Ezuino programming language is an easy alternative programming language and tool, compared to the Arduino C programming language, which the Arduino uses as a stock language.
