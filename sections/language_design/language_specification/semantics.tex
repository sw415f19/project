\section{Semantics (and structural operational semantics figure) (EMPTY)}
The operational semantics are the rules that give our syntax meaning, and without them it would be impossible to make a working language, as a given syntax wouldn't have a clearly defined functionality. For this reason, we will define the operational semantics in this section.

There are 2 different ways of describing semantics of a language. Big-step semantics and small-step semantics. While they are equivalent, there are some advantages and disadvantages to both of them. The big-step semantics evaluates the whole expression from the start to the end expression. Small-step semantics may only evaluate part of the expression one step at a time. The disadvantage of small-step semantics is that it can be daunting to both write and read.

We have decided to make our operational semantics a small-step semantic, as a small-step semantic ruleset is easier to extend in the case of a new feature compared to a big-step semantic ruleset. This means that it would be possible to add parallelity, if we realize that we need it at a later date.
