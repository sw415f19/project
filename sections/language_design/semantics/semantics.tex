\section{Structural Operation Semantics}
The operational semantics are the rules that give our syntax meaning, and without them it would be impossible to make a working language, as a given syntax wouldn't have a clearly defined functionality. For this reason, we will define the operational semantics in this section.

There are 2 different ways of describing semantics of a language. Big-step semantics and small-step semantics. While they are equivalent, there are some advantages and disadvantages to both of them. The big-step semantics evaluates the whole expression from the start to the end expression. Small-step semantics may only evaluate part of the expression one step at a time. The disadvantage of small-step semantics is that it can be daunting to both write and read.

We have decided to make our operational semantics a small-step semantic, as a small-step semantic ruleset is easier to extend in the case of a new feature compared to a big-step semantic ruleset. This means that it would be possible to add parallelity, if we realize that we need it at a later date.

\subsection{Environment-Store Model}
One of the ways we can describe how the Ezuino compiler must handle and store variables, we must just the Environment Store Model (ESM). There are differnet mechanism inside the ESM, and some we will go through the essentials before starting on the semantics. First, we have the location, which marks the location of every variable value in the program. The location keeps track of a variable in the environment $env_v$.
To continue with the ESM, we got the partial function named Store (Sto), which for an instance of the program binds its storage location to values, which are contained within. An example of this, is that if we want to find the value of a specific variable, in this case named x, we write $"sto \  env_v \ x"$.
Next we have the run-time s tack named envl. The runtime stack is a list of pairs ($env_v$, $env_p$).
On figure \ref{evnstoreexmp}, the ESM can be reviewed.
