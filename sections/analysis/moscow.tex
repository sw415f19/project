\subsection{MoSCoW}
%-- MoSCoW til language features (Use MoSCoW to clarify the prioritization of the languages features ex. datastructures, if else for etc.)


This section will provide an account of the different elements, which will be prioritized within a MoSCoW analysis. MoSCoW analysis is an abbreviation for Must have, Could Have, Would have and wont have (this time). This analysis will provide an account and ensure that the critical elements in the programming language will be included in the project.
