\chapter{Introduction}\label{ch:introduction}
This report discusses the creation of a new programming language for Arduino, which is related to the C programming language.\\
The report is structured in order of the creation process of the language, and its corresponding compiler for the target language. The report starts with the design phase, where the language and its features are designed. Followed by the implementation phase, where the designed language is implemented and tested in the target language. The final part of the report is the compiler phase, where the compiler for the language are created and discussed.
\\\\
The focus of the programming language in the report is to be a tool for people with no prior programming experience, to be able to sit down and program any given Arduino for a general purpose task.\\
The idea behind this is that people will be able to buy or build an Arduino based on some blueprint and be able to use the programming language to program their Arduino to operate in whichever way they want.

\section{Initial Problem Statement}\label{ch:InitialProblemStatement}
Is it possible to design a new programming language for Arduino, with the focus on home automation, which is easy to write without prior programming experience and knowledge?

%Arduino C 
%Must write programming language
%Internet of things have more applications especially in home automation
