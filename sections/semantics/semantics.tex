\section{Abstract Syntax for Ezuino}
At this stage, we got the syntax made, and we have a general idea of the language. The next step is to construct semantics for the Ezuino programming language. This chapter will go through each semantic rule, in categorized. 
Before we can start on semantics, we need a table, to provide an overview of the short names in each semantic. This can be  reviewed in figure \ref{semCat}.

\section{Type System Semantics}
The Ezuino programming language data types is only primitive types. This is denoted in future references as :
\begin{table}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{longtable}[c] { r c }
      
        \( { T_{TP} = (string,\ bool,\ double,\ integer)} \) \\
    \end{longtable}
    \caption{}\label{s-empty}
\end{table}

\subsection{Environment-Store Model}
One of the ways we can describe how the Ezuino compiler must handle and store variables, we must just the Environment Store Model (ESM). There are differnet mechanism inside the ESM, and some we will go through the essentials before starting on the semantics. First, we have the location, which marks the location of every variable value in the program. The location keeps track of a variable in the environment {env_v}.
To continue with the ESM, we got the partial function named Store (Sto), which for an instance of the program binds its storage location to values, which are contained within. An example of this, is that if we want to find the value of a specific variable, in this case named x, we write "sto env_v x".
