\chapter{Analysis}\label{ch:ch2label}
\section{Introduction}
In this chapter, we will try to get an understanding of the target group, the programming language, and what the final product should do. The first sections will navigate through the human aspect, which will reflect from who may use the programming language and what their capabilities must reside to use the programming language. Then this chapter will end with a problem scoping and end with a final problem definition, which will be used to work further towards the implementation.
