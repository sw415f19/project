\section{Problem definition}
The next phase after gathering information about current solutions, explaining how the syntax work and the statement from the initial problem, is to define the problem, that this project is trying to solve. \\ The focus in this project is to create a programming language that is easy to use for an average user who may or may not have any experience in programming, while the programming language will be used on an arduino device that will automate a device at home, which is called home automation. So the problem definition is formulated as:\\
\\
\textit{It is a problem that users sometimes forget to close their windows or turn off their lamps, which will increase the bill in electricity, therefore is it possible to create a programming language connected to a device to make those forgetful task automatically}
