\section{Structural Operation Semantics}
The operational semantics is the rules that give our syntax meaning, and without them, it would be impossible to make a working language, as a given syntax wouldn't have a clearly defined functionality. For this reason, we will define the operational semantics in this section.

There are two common ways of describing the semantics of a language. Big-step semantics and small-step semantics. While they are mostly equivalent, there are some advantages and disadvantages to both of them. The big-step semantics evaluates the whole expression from the start to the end expression. Small-step semantics may only evaluate part of the expression one step at a time. The disadvantage of small-step semantics is that it can be daunting to both write and read.

We have decided to make our operational semantics a small-step semantics, as a small-step semantic ruleset is easier to extend in the case of a new feature compared to a big-step semantic ruleset. This means that it would be possible to add parallelity if we realize that we need it at a later date.

\subsection{Environment-Store Model}
To describe how the Ezuino compiler handle and store variables, we will use the environment store model. The different mechanisms in the environment store model will be described before starting on the semantics. First, we have the location, which marks the location of every variable value in the program. The location keeps track of a variable in the environment $env_v$.
To continue with the enviromental store model, we got the partial function named Store (Sto), which for an instance of the program binds its storage location to values, which are contained within. An example of this is that if we want to find the value of a specific variable, in this case, named x, we write $"sto \ env_v \ x"$.
Next, we have the run-time stack named envl. The runtime stack is a list of pairs ($env_v$, $env_p$).
In figure \ref{evnstoreexmp}, a illustration of the environment store model can be reviewed.
