\subsection{MoSCoW}
%-- MoSCoW til language features (Use MoSCoW to clarify the prioritization of the languages features ex. datastructures, if else for etc.)
Now that we have been through which features the Ezuino programming language should reside, we can start doing prioritization of each language feature by using the MoSCoW technique. A MoSCoW technique is an abbreviation for Must have, Should have, Could Have, Would have but wont have (this time), and will provide an account to ensure that the most critical elements in the programming language will be included in the project. As stated in the problem scoping, this technique has been assessed from the most vital elements having heights priority, where the most vital is the basic elements in a programming language.
