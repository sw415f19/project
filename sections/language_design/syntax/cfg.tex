\section{Introduction to Grammar}
This section will explain how the grammar for the syntax language will be generated and the reason why each part of the language was made as it is. 

\subsection{Context Free Grammar (ANTLR4)}
Context free grammar describes the syntax of the language. ANTLR4 which is the parser generator for this language has its own version of EBNF (Extended Backusâ€“Naur form) it uses to implement the syntax.
The different annotation used in order to express EBNF can be seen in the table below.
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ |c|c| } 
 \hline
 ? & Zero or one occurrence\\ 
 \hline
 | & One or the other \\ 
 \hline
 * & Zero or more occurrence \\ 
 \hline
  + & One or more occurrence \\ 
 \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
