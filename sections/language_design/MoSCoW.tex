\section{MoSCoW}
%-- MoSCoW til language features (Use MoSCoW to clarify the prioritization of the languages features ex. datasctructures, if else for etc.)


This section will provide an account for the different elements, which will be prioritised within a MoSCoW analysis. MoSCoW analysis is an abbreviation for Must have, Could Have, Would have and Would have but no at this time. This analysis will provide an account and ensure that the critical elements in the programming language will be included in the project. 

The prioritizing of this analysis is based on initial user interviews and pre-analysis, together with developer opinions, the MoSCoW analysis will be prioritized as the following:\\  

\subsection{Must have}
