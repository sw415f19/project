\section{Type checker}
The type checker implements the semantic rules of Ezuino specified in chapter \ref{semantics}. \\
We split the type checker into two visitors TypeCheckerVisitor and ReturnStatementVisitor. TypeCheckerVisitor checks that the condition in a boolean statement has the correct type and that expressions are legal. ReturnStatementVisitor ensures that the actual returned value of a program matches the type defined in the function declaration.
The way TypeCheckerVisitor type checks expressions is through a setup where every expression node extends that inherits from an interface called ITypeNode. The ITypeNode interface requires that every child class have the method for getting and setting a type attribute. When type checking happens, we then compare each node through the checkType method.

The boolean condition is checked in an if- and else statements.

An example of type checking expressions is when an additive expression is reached, both nodes are type checked.

In a unary expression, it is also necessary to check that the operations performed are done with legal types. If “\texttt{-}” is used on nodes that do not have the type integer or double or if “\texttt{!}” is used on anything than nodes with the type boolean it notifies that there is an error to the errorhandler.

When a return statement is returned it is set to its expression, this is important for type checking the return statement with the function declaration later in ReturnStatementVisitor.
It is also here that return in void functions is implemented. If a return statement has no value,we assume it to be a void function. This in practice makes the return key-word a way to preemptively end void functions.
