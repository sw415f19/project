\section{Problem definition}
After analyzing the target group, current solutions and choosing the programming paradigm, we can create a problem definition. \\ The objective in this project is to create a programming language that is easy to use for an average user who may or may not have any experience in programming. The programming paradigm will be procedural and should be targeted toward Arduino devices that can be used for home automation. So the problem definition is formulated as:\\
\\
\textit{In order to answer an increasing demand for programming knowledge we will make an imperative programming language. A programming language which is easier to learn for people with little or no prior programming experience, in order for them to get knowledge in the field of programming.}
