\chapter{Analysis}\label{ch:ch2label}
In this chapter, we will try to get an understanding of the target group for the programming language Ezuino. The human aspect will be navigated through, which will reflect from who may use the programming language and what their capabilities must reside to use the programming language. Afterwards current programming languages that fulfill these needs will be researched and what paradigm the programming language should be in will be decided. Then this chapter will end with a final problem definition, which will be used to work further towards the design and implementation.
